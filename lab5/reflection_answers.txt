Lab #5

Reflection answers:

1. I used the order of the array returned after querying the database. Firstly I check which links are at which array positions. After that, I create a 2D array with the outgoing links for each page. Each row will contain an array of 1s and 0s. So if the array has N-7 at position 0 and N-0 at position 5, and N-7 has an outgoing link to N-0, the 5th column in row 0 will be set to 1. 

2. With lower alpha values, we achieve convergence faster. This means that if alpha (the probability of teleporting to a random node) is low, we would need fewer iterations to refine the steady state probabilities to get it below a certain threshold. This is mentioned in the slides and reading material.
