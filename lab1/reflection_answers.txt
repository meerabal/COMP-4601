Reflection answers:

1. Data stored in database:

Two main collections:
  1) products
  - stores all the products along with their characteristics
  - format:
    {
      _id: ObjectId,  // id in database
      name: String,   // name of product
      price: Number,  // price of product
      dimensions: { x: Number | String, y: Number | String, z: Number | String}, // dimensions of product
      stock: Number,  // quantity of product in stock
      reviews: String[],  // list of reviews for the product
      id?: Number     // optional id provided by original json file (unused)
    }
  - format example:
    {
      _id: ObjectId("633cc6751f769767fde045ef"),
      name: 'egg',
      price: 2,
      dimensions: { x: 8, y: 10, z: 9 },
      stock: 12,
      reviews: [ 'hello', 'hhh' ]
    }

  2) orders
  - stores all the orders 
  - format:
    {
      _id: ObjectId,  // id in database
      name: String,   // name of the person ordering
      products: String[], // list of products in the order
      count: Number[]     // quantity of each product ordered
    }
  - format example:
    {
      _id: ObjectId("633ccb6c1f769767fde045f0"),
      name: 'unicorn',
      products: [ '633cc6751f769767fde045ef' ],
      count: [ 2 ]
    }

2. Structure of new order data:
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    name: String,
    products: String[],
    count: Number[]
  }
  where each entry in the products array corresponds to its respective quantity in the count array,
  i.e., products[i] has quantity count[i] in a given order (where i is an int, i=0,1,2,...)
  Sent to the server in the form of a JSON request, i.e., a post request containing JSON in the body.

3. You can load data for a specific order with order id = ID by following the given url:
  http://localhost:3000/orders/ID
  i.e., sending a GET request to http://localhost:3000/orders/ID where ID is the id of the order you are trying to look up.
  The products in the order contains an array of links to the product pages to provide easier access.

Apologies for the incomplete submission, I rechecked the video and the audio seems to be working fine in my video submission as well as on the link to kaltura where I uploaded the video. Please let me know if it still doesn't work, I thought uploading it as an alt on mediaspace (kaltura) would be enough but I can create another alt link if need be.
